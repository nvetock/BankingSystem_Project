# BankingSystem_Project
A project where I create a banking system written in C++ that implements OOP, connects to a MySQL database and incorporates unit testing.

## Project Outline
A customer will be able to create/manage an account, check information available to them, and make any desired transactions. This data will be stored in a MySQL database and persist between activations.

An outline of the classes with their functionality
- Customer
    - create an account
    - manage their account
- Account
    - view account info
    - view account balance
    - view transaction history
- Transaction
- Banking Services
    - withdraw
    - deposit
    - transfer

## Nice to have's
- Some level of security that verifies transactions
- Data persistence
- A rough GUI that creates a user-friendly view of the program
